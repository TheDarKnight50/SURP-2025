# SURP-2025: Next-Gen Drug Discovery  
**Under the guidance of Prof. Debabrata Maiti**

## ðŸ“Œ Project Title  
**Next-Gen Drug Discovery: Generative and Reinforcement Learning for Designing Anticancer Molecules**

---

## Project Summary  

This project explores the **fusion of Generative AI and Reinforcement Learning (RL)** to design novel anticancer molecules with optimal biological and chemical properties.  

Leveraging **real-world datasets** of known drug candidates and molecular interactions, students will develop deep learning models capable of generating new, synthesizable compounds. A **reinforcement learning agent** will iteratively refine these designs based on:

- Predicted **activity (ICâ‚…â‚€) values**
- **Docking scores**
- **Drug-likeness filters**

The project builds on **cutting-edge cheminformatics techniques** developed in our lab, including:

- **Molecular embeddings**
- **SMILES-to-property prediction models**
- **Structure-based molecular property estimators**

A rich, hands-on experience at the intersection of **chemistry** and **AI-for-health** â€” ideal for those passionate about **molecular modeling, AI, and impactful interdisciplinary research**.
